# Top 5 benefits of creating your own Angular and API project template

When it's time to start a new project you're faced with the same decisions time and time again: What stack to use, what libraries to utilizing, how to structure the application? Like us, you may start digging through old projects and code to find how you set up some initial boilerplate (i.e. Database Connections, Authentication and Localization). This is a great solution if you're a single developer or on a small team, but what if you no longer have access to the code? Or maybe you're on a larger team and are not the only one responsible for setting up the project. This is where code consistency can fall apart.

That's why we decided to create a project template. For us, we focus mainly on web applications and API back-ends so we decided to go with Angular and ASP.Net Core API. The two work great together with ASP.Net Core already starting us off with a built in Angular template. We then expanded on that to include additional features and functionality. Now we are set up with the tools and boilerplate to get things rolling as quickly as possible. Not only does this save us time but it also helps to keep the team moving in the same direction. We spend less time doing the same things over again, which runs the risk of deviating from our common practices, and more time building awesome applications.

# 1. It's starts your projects off clean and consistent

As more projects are started or new people are added to the team, code consistency becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain. It is like a sink of dirty dishes, the longer you leave it, the bigger the mess gets. To keep the project clean from the beginning you need to start with a strong foundation. 

With the template we have implemented formatters and linters to enforce coding standards and to keep the code in a consistent format. 

1. Problem (Code consistency)
2. Solution (How it solves the problem)
3. Features (Features of the template)
4. Summary (Summarize the problem it solves)

# 2. It boosts your project start time and reduces costs

1. Problem (Time spent doing the same tasks again and again)
2. Solution (Most of the start up time is done, it's familiar)
3. Summarize 

# 3. It acts as a great learning tool for new developers 

1. Describe the problem
2. Define the solution
3. Summarize

# 4. It makes switching between projects a breeze 



# 5. It evolves overtime
